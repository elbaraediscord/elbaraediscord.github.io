# üöÄ Deploy HikmaNova to GitHub Pages - Quick Start

Your HikmaNova website is ready to deploy! Follow these simple steps to get it live at:
**https://elbaraediscord.github.io/elbaraediscord.github.io/**

---

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

- ‚úì Website fully built and tested
- ‚úì Production build created (`dist/public/`)
- ‚úì Vite configured with correct base path (`/elbaraediscord.github.io/`)
- ‚úì Git repository initialized
- ‚úì All files committed and ready to push

---

## üìã Deployment Steps (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Open https://github.com/new
2. Enter these details:
   - **Repository name**: `elbaraediscord.github.io`
   - **Description**: HikmaNova - Innovation & Technology Portfolio
   - **Visibility**: Public ‚≠ê (Required for GitHub Pages)
   - **Initialize repository**: Leave unchecked
3. Click **Create repository**

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Copy and paste these commands into your terminal (in the hikmanova project folder):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/elbaraediscord/elbaraediscord.github.io.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**What this does:**
- Links your local project to the GitHub repository
- Renames the branch to `main`
- Pushes all your code to GitHub

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/elbaraediscord/elbaraediscord.github.io
2. Click **Settings** (top right of the page)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Pages**
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: Select `main`
   - **Folder**: Select `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment

GitHub will now build and deploy your site. This takes 1-2 minutes.

You'll see a message: "Your site is live at https://elbaraediscord.github.io/elbaraediscord.github.io/"

---

## ‚ú® Your Site is Live!

Once deployment completes, visit:
**https://elbaraediscord.github.io/elbaraediscord.github.io/**

---

## üîÑ Making Updates (After Initial Deployment)

To update your website after making changes:

```bash
# Make changes to your code

# Build the project
pnpm build

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update: describe your changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

Your site will automatically update within 1-2 minutes!

---

## üìù Optional: Set Up Automatic Deployments

To automatically build and deploy when you push changes, create a GitHub Actions workflow:

1. Create folder: `.github/workflows/`
2. Create file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
3. Paste this content:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'pnpm'
      
      - name: Install pnpm
        run: npm install -g pnpm
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install
      
      - name: Build
        run: pnpm build
      
      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist/public
```

4. Commit and push:
```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions deployment workflow"
git push origin main
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found" error
- Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first
- Check that the URL is correct: `https://github.com/elbaraediscord/elbaraediscord.github.io.git`

### Site shows 404 or blank page
- Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to finish building
- Refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R to clear cache)
- Check the "Pages" settings to confirm deployment status

### Styles not loading
- This should not happen - the base path is already configured
- If it does, check browser console (F12) for 404 errors
- Verify the branch is set to `main` in Pages settings

### Want to use a custom domain?
- See the "Custom Domain" section in `GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT.md`
